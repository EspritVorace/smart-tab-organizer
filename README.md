![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL_v3-blue.svg)

**SmartTab Organizer** is a Chrome extension designed to help you efficiently manage your browser tabs by automatically grouping related tabs and preventing duplicates.

## Features ✨

### 🖱️ Automatic Grouping
* Middle-click a link to open the tab in the proper group if its domain matches your rules.
* Tabs join an existing group or a new one is created.
* The group name can come from the opener tab's title, from its URL or you can be prompted manually.
* Built-in RegEx presets for popular ticket systems (Jira, GitLab, GitHub, Trello, etc.).

### 🚫 Deduplication
* Opening the same URL twice is prevented.
* The existing tab is re-focused and reloaded.
* Supports several matching modes: exact URL, hostname + path, hostname or simple "includes".

### ⚙️ Options & Customization
* Add, edit, delete and enable/disable domain rules.
* Manage custom and predefined RegEx presets.
* Organize rules in logical groups and choose a color for each group.
* Import/export your settings as JSON.
* Configure deduplication modes.
* View statistics (groups created and tabs deduplicated) and reset them.
* Select Light, Dark or System theme.

### 📊 Quick Access Popup
* Toggle grouping and deduplication globally.
* View key statistics at a glance.
* Shortcut to the options page.

### 🌍 Internationalization
* Available in French (default), English and Spanish.

## Building

Run `npm install` to fetch all dependencies (including dev dependencies like
`esbuild`) then `npm run build`. All files for the extension are produced inside
the `dist/` directory. Load **that** folder (or a zip of it) in Chrome; the HTML
pages in the repository root won't work directly anymore.
